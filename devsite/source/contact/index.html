      <p>
        Pebble is no longer providing direct 1-on-1 support for developers.
        We are now focusing our efforts upon our public support channels,
        which will directly benefit other developers who may be experiencing
        similar issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have shipping, billing or other non-developer related questions,
        please contact <a
        href="http://help.getpebble.com/customer/portal/emails/new">Pebble Support</a>
        instead.
      </p>

      <h3>Developer Support</h3>

        AppGlances, Health etc.)</li>
        <li>4. Provide app configuration options.</li>
        <li>5. Have a complete set of assets, including banners.</li>
